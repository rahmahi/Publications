\title{First Response to Referee Comments for Manuscript BH14505}

\noindent \textbf{Response to First Referee}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The referee says, ``\textit{A brief comparison of this work to other works on periodically driven LMG models and DMBL is needed somewhere in the introductory sections to state what is the significance and novelty of this work. }"\\

\ar{

}
\item The referee says, ``\textit{On page 3, the Floquet eigenstate Thermalization hypothesis is stated without references. }".\\

\ar{

}

\item The referee says, ``\textit{On page 4, after illustrating the resonances in the analytically solvable TFIM model, the authors claim, “This phenomenon is highly general and can be readily adapted to non-integrable systems”. I disagree with the statement, and clear references, if any, need to be cited to back up this statement. The manipulations made for TFIM are fine-tuned to this integrable system, and they break down the moment any integrability-breaking term is introduced. For example, if I add a longitudinal field sigma$_$x to the TFIM, I do not see how to adapt the procedure. }"\\

\ar{

}
\item The referee says,``\textit{In the discussion of phase crossover from thermal to DMBL, increasing N in Fig 8 appears to push the regime of the local phase to a larger drive frequency. This seems to raise the same concerns associated with the stability of disorder-induced localization, as in whether one needs infinite disorder or infinite driving frequency to
get a localization in the thermodynamic limit. Is this the case? }".

\ar{    	
}

\item The referee says,``\textit{Is the heating suppressed at points where the frequency meets the resonance condition? }".

\ar{

}

\item The referee says, ``\textit{The discussion related to Fig. 9 could be improved, and it is not clear to me why the standard deviation of temporal fluctuations should vanish for thermalizing systems. }"\\

\ar{

}

\item The referee says,``\textit{In the conclusion, it is useful to comment on whether this method could be adapted (related to my point 2) to other generic models (say
	XXZ models). }"\\
