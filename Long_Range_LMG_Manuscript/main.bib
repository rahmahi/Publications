	abstract = {Many-body localization ({MBL}) provides a mechanism to avoid thermalization in many-body quantum systems. Here, we show that an emergent symmetry can protect a state from {MBL}. Specifically, we propose a Z2 symmetric model with nonlocal interactions, which has an analytically known, {SU}(2) invariant, critical ground state. At large disorder strength, all states at finite energy density are in a glassy {MBL} phase, while the lowest energy states are not. These do, however, localize when a perturbation destroys the emergent {SU}(2) symmetry. The model also provides an example of {MBL} in the presence of nonlocal, disordered interactions that are more structured than a power law. Finally, we show how the protected state can be moved into the bulk of the spectrum.},

	abstract = {Systems of particles interacting with long range interactions present generically ”quasi-stationary states” ({QSS}), which are approximately time-independent out of equilibrium states. In this proceedings, we explore the generalization of the formation of such {QSS} and their relaxation from the much studied case of gravity to a generic pair interaction with the asymptotic form of the potential v(r) ∼ 1/r γ with γ \&gt; 0 in d dimensions. We compute analytic estimations of the relaxation time calculating the rate of two body collisionality in a virialized system approximated as homogeneous. We show that for γ \&lt; (d − 1/2), the collision integral is dominated by the size of the system, while for γ \&gt; (d − 1/2), it is dominated by small impact parameters. In addition, the lifetime of {QSS} increases with the number of particles if γ \&lt; d − 1 (i.e. the force is not integrable) and decreases if γ \&gt; d − 1. Using numerical simulations we confirm our analytic results. A corollary of our work gives a ”dynamical” classification of interactions: the dynamical properties of the system depend on whether the pair force is integrable or not.},

Here we discuss two recently explored non-equilibrium scenarios where external periodic drive applied to closed (i.e., not attached to any external bath) quantum many-body systems have apparently opposite effects in respective cases. In one case it freezes/localizes a disorder free system dynamically, while in the other it delocalizes a disordered many-body localized system, and quantum interference is responsible for both the effects. We review these in the perspective of more general questions of ergodicity, energy absorption, asymptotic behavior, and finally the essential role of quantum mechanics in understanding these issues in periodically driven closed many-body systems. In this article we intend to deliver a non-technical account of some recent developments in this field in a manner accessible to a broad readership.},

	doi = {10.1088/1361-6633/aac9f1},
	abstract = {The emergence of statistical mechanics for isolated classical systems comes about through chaotic dynamics and ergodicity. Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

  abstract = {We review some recent developments in the statistical mechanics of isolated quantum systems. We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

This second edition begins with a new section suitable for an introductory course on quantum phase transitions, assuming no prior knowledge of quantum field theory. It also contains several new chapters to cover important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory.},

The most significant new features include efficient solvers for arbitrary time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators, support for the Floquet formalism, and new solvers for Bloch–Redfield and Floquet–Markov master equations. Here we introduce these new features, demonstrate their use, and give a summary of the important backward-incompatible API changes introduced in this version.

Comm. 183 (2012) 1760 Does the new version supercede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Dynamics of open quantum systems Solution method: Numerical solutions to Lindblad, Floquet–Markov, and Bloch–Redfield master equations, as well as the Monte Carlo wave function method. Reasons for new version: Compared to the preceding version we have introduced numerous new features, enhanced performance, and made changes in the Application Programming Interface (API) for improved functionality and consistency within the package, as well as increased compatibility with existing conventions used in other scientific software packages for Python. The most significant new features include efficient solvers for arbitrary time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators, support for the Floquet formalism, and new solvers for Bloch–Redfield and Floquet–Markov master equations.
