	abstract = {Localization and delocalization of quantum diffusion in a time-continuous one-dimensional Anderson model perturbed by the quasiperiodic harmonic oscillations of M colors is investigated systematically, which has been partly reported by a preliminary Letter [H. S. Yamada and K. S. Ikeda, Phys. Rev. E 103, L040202 (2021)]. We investigate in detail the localization-delocalization characteristics of the model with respect to three parameters: the disorder strength W, the perturbation strength ε, and the number of colors, M, which plays the similar role of spatial dimension. In particular, attention is focused on the presence of localization-delocalization transition ({LDT}) and its critical properties. For M≥3 the {LDT} exists and a normal diffusion is recovered above a critical strength ε, and the characteristics of diffusion dynamics mimic the diffusion process predicted for the stochastically perturbed Anderson model even though M is not large. These results are compared with the results of discrete-time quantum maps, i.e., the Anderson map and the standard map. Further, the features of delocalized dynamics are discussed in comparison with a limit model which has no static disordered part.},

However, in the presence of interactions such systems are expected to eventually heat up to a simple infinite-temperature state. One possible exception is a periodically driven many-body localized system, in which heating is precluded by strong disorder. Here, we use a gas of ultracold fermionic potassium atoms in optical lattices to prepare and probe such a driven system and show that it is indeed stable for high enough driving frequency. Moreover, we find a novel regime in which the system is exceedingly stable even at low drive frequencies, a particular feature of our driving scheme. Our experimental findings are well supported by numerical simulations and may provide avenues for engineering novel phases in periodically driven matter.},

The complexity of the combination of many-body correlations and dynamic manipulations has the potential to uncover a whole field of new phenomena, but the theoretical and numerical understanding becomes extremely difficult. We now propose a promising numerical method by generalizing the density matrix renormalization group to a superposition of Fourier components of periodically driven many-body systems using Floquet theory. With this method we can study the full time-dependent quantum solution in a large parameter range for all evolution times, beyond the commonly used high-frequency approximations. Numerical results are presented for the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain under both local(edge) and global driving for spin-spin correlations and temporal fluctuations. As the frequency is lowered, we demonstrate that more and more Fourier components become relevant and determine strong length- and frequency-dependent changes of the quantum correlations that cannot be described by effective static models.},

We consider a disordered quantum Ising chain where the transverse magnetization relaxes exponentially with time with a decay time-scale τ due to random longitudinal interactions between the spins. We show that, under external periodic drive, this relaxation slows down (τ shoots up) by orders of magnitude as the ratio of the drive frequency ω and amplitude h0 tends to certain specific values (the freezing condition). If ω is increased while maintaining the ratio h0/ω at a fixed freezing value, then τ diverges exponentially with ω.

	abstract = {For systems with long-range interactions, the two-body potential decays at large distances as V(r)∼1/rα, with α≤d, where d is the space dimension. Examples are: gravitational systems, two-dimensional hydrodynamics, two-dimensional elasticity, charged and dipolar systems. Although such systems can be made extensive, they are intrinsically non additive: the sum of the energies of macroscopic subsystems is not equal to the energy of the whole system. Moreover, the space of accessible macroscopic thermodynamic parameters might be non convex. The violation of these two basic properties of the thermodynamics of short-range systems is at the origin of ensemble inequivalence. In turn, this inequivalence implies that specific heat can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble, and temperature jumps can appear at microcanonical first order phase transitions. The lack of convexity allows us to easily spot regions of parameter space where ergodicity may be broken. Historically, negative specific heat had been found for gravitational systems and was thought to be a specific property of a system for which the existence of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics itself was doubted. Realizing that such properties may be present for a wider class of systems has renewed the interest in long-range interactions. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the recent advances on the statistical mechanics and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of solvable systems with long-range interactions. The core of the review consists in the detailed presentation of the concept of ensemble inequivalence, as exemplified by the exact solution, in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles, of mean-field type models. Remarkably, the entropy of all these models can be obtained using the method of large deviations. Long-range interacting systems display an extremely slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium and, what is more striking, the convergence towards quasi-stationary states. The understanding of such unusual relaxation process is obtained by the introduction of an appropriate kinetic theory based on the Vlasov equation. A statistical approach, founded on a variational principle introduced by Lynden-Bell, is shown to explain qualitatively and quantitatively some features of quasi-stationary states. Generalizations to models with both short and long-range interactions, and to models with weakly decaying interactions, show the robustness of the effects obtained for mean-field models.},

Some models for which {NMFE} are valid will briefly be reviewed.

These extra stable states appear discontinuously. The application of these techniques to structured models of spin glasses and neural networks will also be briefly reviewed.},

At large disorder strength, all states at finite energy density are in a glassy {MBL} phase, while the lowest energy states are not. These do, however, localize when a perturbation destroys the emergent {SU}(2) symmetry.

In a periodically driven classical thermodynamic system, freezing at high ω occurs when 1/ω is much smaller than the characteristic relaxation time of the system and hence the freezing always increases there as ω is increased. Here, in the contrary, we see surprising nonmonotonic freezing behavior of the response with ω, showing curious peak-valley structure. Quite interestingly, the entire system tends to freeze almost absolutely (the freezing peaks) when driven with a certain combination of driving parameters values (amplitude and ω) due to coherent suppression of dynamics of the quantum many-body modes, which has no classical analog. We demonstrate this new freezing phenomenon analytically (supported by large-scale numerics) for a general class of integrable quantum spin systems.},

We compute analytic estimations of the relaxation time calculating the rate of two body collisionality in a virialized system approximated as homogeneous. We show that for γ \&lt; (d − 1/2), the collision integral is dominated by the size of the system, while for γ \&gt; (d − 1/2), it is dominated by small impact parameters. In addition, the lifetime of {QSS} increases with the number of particles if γ \&lt; d − 1 (i.e. the force is not integrable) and decreases if γ \&gt; d − 1. Using numerical simulations we confirm our analytic results. A corollary of our work gives a ”dynamical” classification of interactions: the dynamical properties of the system depend on whether the pair force is integrable or not.},

When the dynamics is ergodic, the Floquet spectrum obeys a Wigner-Dyson statistics and the system satisfies the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ({ETH}): Independently of the initial state, local observables relax to the thermal value, and Floquet states are delocalized in the Hilbert space. On the contrary, if the classical dynamics is regular no thermalization occurs. We further discuss the relationship between ergodicity and dynamical phase transitions, and the relevance of our results to other fully connected periodically driven models (like the Bose-Hubbard one), and possibilities of experimental realization in the case of two coupled {BEC}.},

It turns out that long-range interactions give rise to a big timescale separation, which causes prethermalization for all . This conclusion is deduced by comparing two important timescales relevant for relaxation dynamics; one is the relaxation time of local permutation operators, which are quasi-conserved quantities in this system, and the other is the timescale of the initial relaxation of local quantities due to the growth of quantum fluctuations. We also explore the entire nonequilibrium dynamics by using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is consistent with the result mentioned above.},

Here we discuss two recently explored non-equilibrium scenarios where external periodic drive applied to closed (i.e., not attached to any external bath) quantum many-body systems have apparently opposite effects in respective cases. In one case it freezes/localizes a disorder free system dynamically, while in the other it delocalizes a disordered many-body localized system, and quantum interference is responsible for both the effects. We review these in the perspective of more general questions of ergodicity, energy absorption, asymptotic behavior, and finally the essential role of quantum mechanics in understanding these issues in periodically driven closed many-body systems. In this article we intend to deliver a non-technical account of some recent developments in this field in a manner accessible to a broad readership.},

We illustrate this ability by formulating an Otto engine cycle for a quantum many-body system. The system is ramped between a strongly localized {MBL} regime and a thermal (or weakly localized) regime. The difference between the energy-level correlations of {MBL} systems and of thermal systems enables mesoscale engines to run in parallel in the thermodynamic limit, enhances the engine's reliability, and suppresses worst-case trials. We estimate analytically and calculate numerically the engine's efficiency and per-cycle power. The efficiency mirrors the efficiency of the conventional thermodynamic Otto engine. The per-cycle power scales linearly with the system size and inverse-exponentially with a localization length. This work introduces a thermodynamic lens onto {MBL}, which, having been studied much recently, can now be considered for use in thermodynamic tasks.},

A key result is to show that there are universal correlations between the matrix elements of local observables and the many-body level spectrum. This reveals how the matrix elements encode the energy scales associated with resonance, thereby allowing us to show that these energies are power-law-distributed. Using these results, we calculate analytically the distributions of local polarizations and of eigenstate fidelity susceptibilities. The first of these quantities characterizes the proximity of {MBL} systems to noninteracting ones, while the second highlights their extreme sensitivity to local perturbations. Our theoretical approach is to consider the effect of varying a local field, which induces a parametric dynamics of spectral properties. We corroborate our results numerically using exact diagonalization in finite systems.},

We then demonstrate that tunneling can be successfully restored in the lattice by applying a resonant sinusoidal modulation to the lattice position, an effect that is a direct analogue of photon-assisted tunneling. This precise tuning of the tunneling matrix elements, through resonant modulation-assisted tunneling, opens a novel route for the creation of gauge fields in laser-fabricated photonic lattices.},

Here, we consider a chaotic disordered many-body quantum system and search for a relationship between self-averaging behavior and the properties of the distributions over disorder realizations of various quantities and at different timescales. An exponential distribution, as found for the survival probability at long times, explains its lack of self-averaging, since the mean and the dispersion are equal. Gaussian distributions, however, are obtained for both self-averaging and non-self-averaging quantities. Our studies show also that one can make conclusions about the self-averaging behavior of one quantity based on the distribution of another related quantity. This strategy allows for semianalytical results, and thus circumvents the limitations of numerical scaling analysis, which are restricted to few system sizes.},

From a dynamical point of view, T is proportional to the stationary return probability to an initial basis state, averaged over all the basis states (initial conditions). We find that T exhibits an exponential growth, T∼exp({aN}), in the gapped phase of the model and a linear scaling, T∼N, in the gapless phase. These two different behaviors are analyzed in terms of the distribution of the participation ratios of individual eigenstates. We also investigate the effect of next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which break the integrability of the model.

Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden. }

	abstract = {Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all systems fall into this category, with many-body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at nonzero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and nonequilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasilocal integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasilocal integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. An outline is given of the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. Recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed, are reviewed. This Colloquium concludes by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},
