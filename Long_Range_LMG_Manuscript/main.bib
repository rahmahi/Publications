  abstract =      {When classical systems fail to explore their entire
                   configurational space, intriguing macroscopic
                   phenomena like aging and glass formation may emerge.
                   Also closed quanto-mechanical systems may stop
                   wandering freely around the whole Hilbert space, even
                   if they are initially prepared into a macroscopically
                   large combination of eigenstates. Here, we report
                   numerical evidences that the dynamics of strongly
                   interacting lattice bosons driven sufficiently far
                   from equilibrium can be trapped into extremely
                   long-lived inhomogeneous metastable states. The
                   slowing down of incoherent density excitations above
                   a threshold energy, much reminiscent of a dynamical
                   arrest on the verge of a glass transition, is
                   identified as the key feature of this phenomenon. We
                   argue that the resulting long-lived inhomogeneities
                   are responsible for the lack of thermalization
                   observed in large systems. Such a rich phenomenology
                   could be experimentally uncovered upon probing the
                   out-of-equilibrium dynamics of conveniently prepared
                   quantum states of trapped cold atoms which we hereby
                   suggest.},

  abstract  = {We propose and explore a new finite temperature phase
                   of translationally invariant multi-component liquids
                   which we call a ‘Quantum Disentangled Liquid’
                   (QDL) phase. We contemplate the possibility that in
                   fluids consisting of two (or more) species of
                   indistinguishable quantum particles with a large mass
                   ratio, the light particles might ‘localize’ on
                   the heavy particles. We give a precise, formal
                   definition of this QDL phase in terms of the finite
                   energy density many-particle wavefunctions. While the
                   heavy particles are fully thermalized, for a typical
                   fixed configuration of the heavy particles, the
                   entanglement entropy of the light particles satisfies
                   an area law; this implies that the light particles
                   have not thermalized. Equivalently, but more
                   intuitively, if the positions of all the heavy
                   particles are measured, the projected wavefunction
                   for the unmeasured light particles has as an area law
                   entanglement entropy. Thus, in a QDL phase, thermal
                   equilibration is incomplete, and the canonical
                   assumptions of statistical mechanics are not fully
                   operative. The definition of the QDL phase for
                   heavy/light particles can be readily generalized to
                   other cases with two (or more) conserved currents,
                   such as spin/charge in a system of spin-1/2 fermions
                   (as in a Hubbard model). Indeed, we argue that the
                   finite energy-density eigenstates of the t–J model
                   will generically be in such a spin/charge QDL,
                   although the fate of the QDL in the large U Hubbard
                   model is uncertain. We explore the possibility of QDL
                   in water, with the light proton degrees of freedom
                   becoming ‘localized’ on the oxygen ions. While we
                   do not presently know whether a local, generic
                   Hamiltonian can have eigenstates of the QDL form, if
                   not, then the non-thermal behavior discussed here
                   will exist as an interesting crossover phenomena at a
                   time scale that diverges as the ratio of the mass of
                   the heavy to the light particles also diverges.},

                   (API) for improved functionality and consistency
                   within the package, as well as increased
                   compatibility with existing conventions used in other
                   scientific software packages for Python. The most
                   significant new features include efficient solvers
                   for arbitrary time-dependent Hamiltonians and
                   collapse operators, support for the Floquet
                   formalism, and new solvers for Bloch–Redfield and
                   Floquet–Markov master equations. Here we introduce
                   these new features, demonstrate their use, and give a
                   summary of the important backward-incompatible API
                   changes introduced in this version. Program Summary

                   183 (2012) 1760 Does the new version supercede the
                   previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Dynamics of
                   open quantum systems Solution method: Numerical
                   solutions to Lindblad, Floquet–Markov, and
                   Bloch–Redfield master equations, as well as the
                   Monte Carlo wave function method. Reasons for new
                   version: Compared to the preceding version we have
                   introduced numerous new features, enhanced
                   performance, and made changes in the Application
                   Programming Interface (API) for improved
                   functionality and consistency within the package, as
                   well as increased compatibility with existing
                   conventions used in other scientific software
                   packages for Python. The most significant new
                   features include efficient solvers for arbitrary
                   time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators,
                   support for the Floquet formalism, and new solvers
                   for Bloch–Redfield and Floquet–Markov master
                   equations. Restrictions: Problems must meet the
                   criteria for using the master equation in Lindblad,
                   Floquet–Markov, or Bloch–Redfield form. Running
                   time: A few seconds up to several tens of hours,
                   depending on size of the underlying Hilbert space.},

  abstract =      {Describing the physical properties of quantum
                   materials near critical points with long-range
                   many-body quantum entanglement, this book introduces
                   readers to the basic theory of quantum phases, their
                   phase transitions and their observable properties.
                   This second edition begins with a new section
                   suitable for an introductory course on quantum phase
                   transitions, assuming no prior knowledge of quantum
                   field theory. It also contains several new chapters
                   to cover important recent advances, such as the Fermi
                   gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and
                   their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and
                   solvable models obtained from string theory. After
                   introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a
                   detailed description of the canonical
                   quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero
                   temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex
                   models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate
                   students and researchers in condensed matter physics
                   and particle and string theory.},
