	abstract = {Localization and delocalization of quantum diffusion in a time-continuous one-dimensional Anderson model perturbed by the quasiperiodic harmonic oscillations of M colors is investigated systematically, which has been partly reported by a preliminary Letter [H. S. Yamada and K. S. Ikeda, Phys. Rev. E 103, L040202 (2021)]. We investigate in detail the localization-delocalization characteristics of the model with respect to three parameters: the disorder strength W, the perturbation strength ε, and the number of colors, M, which plays the similar role of spatial dimension. In particular, attention is focused on the presence of localization-delocalization transition ({LDT}) and its critical properties. For M≥3 the {LDT} exists and a normal diffusion is recovered above a critical strength ε, and the characteristics of diffusion dynamics mimic the diffusion process predicted for the stochastically perturbed Anderson model even though M is not large. These results are compared with the results of discrete-time quantum maps, i.e., the Anderson map and the standard map. Further, the features of delocalized dynamics are discussed in comparison with a limit model which has no static disordered part.},

	abstract = {Dynamical localization is one of the most startling manifestations of quantum interference, where the evolution of a simple system is frozen out under a suitably tuned coherent periodic drive. Here we show that, although any randomness in the interactions of a many-body system kills dynamical localization eventually, spectacular remnants survive even when the disorder is strong. We consider a disordered quantum Ising chain where the transverse magnetization relaxes exponentially with time with a decay time-scale τ due to random longitudinal interactions between the spins. We show that, under external periodic drive, this relaxation slows down (τ shoots up) by orders of magnitude as the ratio of the drive frequency ω and amplitude h0 tends to certain specific values (the freezing condition). If ω is increased while maintaining the ratio h0/ω at a fixed freezing value, then τ diverges exponentially with ω. The results can be easily extended for a larger family of disordered fermionic and bosonic systems.},

	abstract = {For systems with long-range interactions, the two-body potential decays at large distances as V(r)∼1/rα, with α≤d, where d is the space dimension. Examples are: gravitational systems, two-dimensional hydrodynamics, two-dimensional elasticity, charged and dipolar systems. Although such systems can be made extensive, they are intrinsically non additive: the sum of the energies of macroscopic subsystems is not equal to the energy of the whole system. Moreover, the space of accessible macroscopic thermodynamic parameters might be non convex. The violation of these two basic properties of the thermodynamics of short-range systems is at the origin of ensemble inequivalence. In turn, this inequivalence implies that specific heat can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble, and temperature jumps can appear at microcanonical first order phase transitions. The lack of convexity allows us to easily spot regions of parameter space where ergodicity may be broken. Historically, negative specific heat had been found for gravitational systems and was thought to be a specific property of a system for which the existence of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics itself was doubted. Realizing that such properties may be present for a wider class of systems has renewed the interest in long-range interactions. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the recent advances on the statistical mechanics and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of solvable systems with long-range interactions. The core of the review consists in the detailed presentation of the concept of ensemble inequivalence, as exemplified by the exact solution, in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles, of mean-field type models. Remarkably, the entropy of all these models can be obtained using the method of large deviations. Long-range interacting systems display an extremely slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium and, what is more striking, the convergence towards quasi-stationary states. The understanding of such unusual relaxation process is obtained by the introduction of an appropriate kinetic theory based on the Vlasov equation. A statistical approach, founded on a variational principle introduced by Lynden-Bell, is shown to explain qualitatively and quantitatively some features of quasi-stationary states. Generalizations to models with both short and long-range interactions, and to models with weakly decaying interactions, show the robustness of the effects obtained for mean-field models.},

Some models for which {NMFE} are valid will briefly be reviewed. It is found that, for certain choices of the interaction architecture, ferromagnetic systems (Jij ⩾ 0) exhibit weak spin-glass-like behaviour in the sense that they have many stable states and not just those associated with ferromagnetism. These extra stable states appear discontinuously. The application of these techniques to structured models of spin glasses and neural networks will also be briefly reviewed.},

At large disorder strength, all states at finite energy density are in a glassy {MBL} phase, while the lowest energy states are not. These do, however, localize when a perturbation destroys the emergent {SU}(2) symmetry. The model also provides an example of {MBL} in the presence of nonlocal, disordered interactions that are more structured than a power law. Finally, we show how the protected state can be moved into the bulk of the spectrum.},

A perturbation expansion is then developed which provides for all temperatures an approximate description of the model. The perturbation series is classified with respect to the small parameter 1/z, where z is the number of psins interacting with a given spin; this generates the molecular-field approximation and the random-phase approximation as the lowest-order description of the thermodynamic functions and correlation functions respectively. The leading-order approximations for the correlation functions, susceptibilities and spectral functions are discussed in detail. The formalism, which is the first application of such techniques to systems with varying magnetization direction, provides a basis for subsequent higher-order calculations of the free energy and correlation functions.},

	abstract = {Quantum interference lies at the heart of several surprising equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena in many-body Physics. Here we discuss two recently explored non-equilibrium scenarios where external periodic drive applied to closed (i.e., not attached to any external bath) quantum many-body systems have apparently opposite effects in respective cases. In one case it freezes/localizes a disorder free system dynamically, while in the other it delocalizes a disordered many-body localized system, and quantum interference is responsible for both the effects. We review these in the perspective of more general questions of ergodicity, energy absorption, asymptotic behavior, and finally the essential role of quantum mechanics in understanding these issues in periodically driven closed many-body systems. In this article we intend to deliver a non-technical account of some recent developments in this field in a manner accessible to a broad readership.},

	abstract = {Many-body-localized ({MBL}) systems do not thermalize under their intrinsic dynamics. The athermality of {MBL}, we propose, can be harnessed for thermodynamic tasks. We illustrate this ability by formulating an Otto engine cycle for a quantum many-body system. The system is ramped between a strongly localized {MBL} regime and a thermal (or weakly localized) regime. The difference between the energy-level correlations of {MBL} systems and of thermal systems enables mesoscale engines to run in parallel in the thermodynamic limit, enhances the engine's reliability, and suppresses worst-case trials. We estimate analytically and calculate numerically the engine's efficiency and per-cycle power. The efficiency mirrors the efficiency of the conventional thermodynamic Otto engine. The per-cycle power scales linearly with the system size and inverse-exponentially with a localization length. This work introduces a thermodynamic lens onto {MBL}, which, having been studied much recently, can now be considered for use in thermodynamic tasks.},

  abstract = {We formulate a theory for resonances in the many-body localized ({MBL}) phase of disordered quantum spin chains in terms of local observables. A key result is to show that there are universal correlations between the matrix elements of local observables and the many-body level spectrum. This reveals how the matrix elements encode the energy scales associated with resonance, thereby allowing us to show that these energies are power-law-distributed. Using these results, we calculate analytically the distributions of local polarizations and of eigenstate fidelity susceptibilities. The first of these quantities characterizes the proximity of {MBL} systems to noninteracting ones, while the second highlights their extreme sensitivity to local perturbations. Our theoretical approach is to consider the effect of varying a local field, which induces a parametric dynamics of spectral properties. We corroborate our results numerically using exact diagonalization in finite systems.},

By correctly tuning the strength of inter-site coupling in the lattice, we observe that W–S states become increasingly localized, and eventually fully localized to one site, as the curvature of the lattice is increased. We then demonstrate that tunneling can be successfully restored in the lattice by applying a resonant sinusoidal modulation to the lattice position, an effect that is a direct analogue of photon-assisted tunneling. This precise tuning of the tunneling matrix elements, through resonant modulation-assisted tunneling, opens a novel route for the creation of gauge fields in laser-fabricated photonic lattices.},

Here, we consider a chaotic disordered many-body quantum system and search for a relationship between self-averaging behavior and the properties of the distributions over disorder realizations of various quantities and at different timescales. An exponential distribution, as found for the survival probability at long times, explains its lack of self-averaging, since the mean and the dispersion are equal. Gaussian distributions, however, are obtained for both self-averaging and non-self-averaging quantities. Our studies show also that one can make conclusions about the self-averaging behavior of one quantity based on the distribution of another related quantity. This strategy allows for semianalytical results, and thus circumvents the limitations of numerical scaling analysis, which are restricted to few system sizes.},

From a dynamical point of view, T is proportional to the stationary return probability to an initial basis state, averaged over all the basis states (initial conditions). We find that T exhibits an exponential growth, T∼exp({aN}), in the gapped phase of the model and a linear scaling, T∼N, in the gapless phase. These two different behaviors are analyzed in terms of the distribution of the participation ratios of individual eigenstates. We also investigate the effect of next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which break the integrability of the model. Although the massive phase of the nonintegrable model also has T∼exp({aN}), in the gapless phase T appears to saturate to a constant value.},

Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

Absence of thermalization is analytically demonstrated for a large class of quite common pre- and post-quench spin Hamiltonians. The main requirement is that the pre-quench Hamiltonian must exhibit a Z 2 (spin-flip) symmetry, which would be spontaneously broken in the thermodynamic limit, though we actually focus on finite (but large) systems. On the other hand, the post-quench Hamiltonian must violate the Z 2 symmetry, but for the rest may be non-integrable and may obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for (sums of) few-body observables.},

  abstract   = {Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all systems fall into this category, with many-body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at nonzero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and nonequilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasilocal integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasilocal integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. An outline is given of the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. Recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed, are reviewed. This Colloquium concludes by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},

We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

  abstract = {We develop a theory to derive effective Floquet Hamiltonians in the weak-drive and low-frequency regime. We construct the theory in analogy with band theory for electrons in a spatially periodic and weak potential, such as occurs in some crystalline materials. As a prototypical example, we apply this theory to graphene driven by circularly polarized light of low intensity. We find an analytic expression for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian in the low-frequency regime which accurately predicts the quasienergy spectrum and the Floquet states. Furthermore, we identify self-consistency as the crucial feature effective Hamiltonians in this regime need to satisfy to achieve high accuracy. The method is useful in providing a realistic description of off-resonant drives for multiband solid-state systems where light-induced topological band structure changes are sought.},

This so-called Floquet engineering approach is currently limited to the description of wave-packet dynamics. Here, we utilize the notion of effective Hamiltonians and develop a Floquet engineering scattering formalism that relies on a systematic high-frequency expansion of the scattering matrix. The method unveils the critical role of micromotion. An application to the case of nonreciprocal transport is presented.},

  abstract = {The nature of the dynamical quantum phase transition between the many-body localized (MBL) phase and the thermal phase remains an open question, and one line of attack on this problem is to explore this transition numerically in finite-size systems. To maximize the contrast between the MBL phase and the thermal phase in such finite-size systems, we argue one should choose a Floquet model with no local conservation laws and rapid thermalization to “infinite temperature” in the thermal phase. Here we introduce and explore such a Floquet spin chain model and show that standard diagnostics of the MBL-to-thermal transition behave well in this model even at modest sizes. We also introduce a physically motivated space-time correlation function, which peaks at the transition in the Floquet model, but is strongly affected by conservation laws in Hamiltonian models.},

  abstract = {We study many-body localization (MBL) for interacting one-dimensional lattice fermions in random (Anderson) and quasiperiodic (Aubry-Andre) models, focusing on the role of interaction range. We obtain the MBL quantum phase diagrams by calculating the experimentally relevant inverse participation ratio (IPR) at half-filling using exact diagonalization methods and extrapolating to the infinite system size. For short-range interactions, our results produce in the phase diagram a qualitative symmetry between weak and strong interaction limits. For long-range interactions, no such symmetry exists as the strongly interacting system is always many-body localized, independent of the effective disorder strength, and the system is analogous to a pinned Wigner crystal. We obtain various scaling exponents for the IPR, suggesting conditions for different MBL regimes arising from interaction effects.},

In contrast, here we show that their disordered Floquet many-body localized counterparts can exhibit distinct ordered phases delineated by sharp transitions. Some of these are analogs of equilibrium states with broken symmetries and topological order, while others—genuinely new to the Floquet problem—are characterized by order and nontrivial periodic dynamics. We illustrate these ideas in driven spin chains with Ising symmetry.},

It also contains several new chapters to cover important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory.},
