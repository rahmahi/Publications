@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="When frozen, $\ket {\psi (t)}\approx \ket {s_N}$. From eqn~\ref {eq:driven:ham}, $\expval {\protect \hat  {H}_{0,1}}$ are both approximately constant. Averaging the square of $\expval {\protect \hat  {H}(t)}$ over long times $\tau \gg T$ yields a result that goes as $h^2 + \delta $, where $\delta \sim h_0\ll 1$. Thus, the standard deviation in time will go as $\sim h\sim \omega $, since $\eta =4h/\omega $ is kept fixed."}
