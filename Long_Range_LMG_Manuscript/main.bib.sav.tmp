	abstract = {Localization and delocalization of quantum diffusion in a time-continuous one-dimensional Anderson model perturbed by the quasiperiodic harmonic oscillations of M colors is investigated systematically, which has been partly reported by a preliminary Letter [H. S. Yamada and K. S. Ikeda, Phys. Rev. E 103, L040202 (2021)]. We investigate in detail the localization-delocalization characteristics of the model with respect to three parameters: the disorder strength W, the perturbation strength ε, and the number of colors, M, which plays the similar role of spatial dimension. In particular, attention is focused on the presence of localization-delocalization transition ({LDT}) and its critical properties. For M≥3 the {LDT} exists and a normal diffusion is recovered above a critical strength ε, and the characteristics of diffusion dynamics mimic the diffusion process predicted for the stochastically perturbed Anderson model even though M is not large. These results are compared with the results of discrete-time quantum maps, i.e., the Anderson map and the standard map. Further, the features of delocalized dynamics are discussed in comparison with a limit model which has no static disordered part.},

However, in the presence of interactions such systems are expected to eventually heat up to a simple infinite-temperature state. One possible exception is a periodically driven many-body localized system, in which heating is precluded by strong disorder. Here, we use a gas of ultracold fermionic potassium atoms in optical lattices to prepare and probe such a driven system and show that it is indeed stable for high enough driving frequency. Moreover, we find a novel regime in which the system is exceedingly stable even at low drive frequencies, a particular feature of our driving scheme. Our experimental findings are well supported by numerical simulations and may provide avenues for engineering novel phases in periodically driven matter.},

In this article, we critically examine how the results for different model types and coupling schemes, as well as varying implicit interpretations of terms such as coexistence, synchrony and incoherence, have influenced the common understanding of what constitutes a chimera. We cover both theoretical and experimental systems, address various chimera-derived terms that have emerged over the years and finally reflect on the question of chimera states in real-world contexts.},

The complexity of the combination of many-body correlations and dynamic manipulations has the potential to uncover a whole field of new phenomena, but the theoretical and numerical understanding becomes extremely difficult. We now propose a promising numerical method by generalizing the density matrix renormalization group to a superposition of Fourier components of periodically driven many-body systems using Floquet theory. With this method we can study the full time-dependent quantum solution in a large parameter range for all evolution times, beyond the commonly used high-frequency approximations. Numerical results are presented for the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chain under both local(edge) and global driving for spin-spin correlations and temporal fluctuations. As the frequency is lowered, we demonstrate that more and more Fourier components become relevant and determine strong length- and frequency-dependent changes of the quantum correlations that cannot be described by effective static models.},

We consider a disordered quantum Ising chain where the transverse magnetization relaxes exponentially with time with a decay time-scale τ due to random longitudinal interactions between the spins. We show that, under external periodic drive, this relaxation slows down (τ shoots up) by orders of magnitude as the ratio of the drive frequency ω and amplitude h0 tends to certain specific values (the freezing condition). If ω is increased while maintaining the ratio h0/ω at a fixed freezing value, then τ diverges exponentially with ω.

	abstract = {For systems with long-range interactions, the two-body potential decays at large distances as V(r)∼1/rα, with α≤d, where d is the space dimension. Examples are: gravitational systems, two-dimensional hydrodynamics, two-dimensional elasticity, charged and dipolar systems. Although such systems can be made extensive, they are intrinsically non additive: the sum of the energies of macroscopic subsystems is not equal to the energy of the whole system. Moreover, the space of accessible macroscopic thermodynamic parameters might be non convex. The violation of these two basic properties of the thermodynamics of short-range systems is at the origin of ensemble inequivalence. In turn, this inequivalence implies that specific heat can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble, and temperature jumps can appear at microcanonical first order phase transitions. The lack of convexity allows us to easily spot regions of parameter space where ergodicity may be broken. Historically, negative specific heat had been found for gravitational systems and was thought to be a specific property of a system for which the existence of standard equilibrium statistical mechanics itself was doubted. Realizing that such properties may be present for a wider class of systems has renewed the interest in long-range interactions. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the recent advances on the statistical mechanics and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of solvable systems with long-range interactions. The core of the review consists in the detailed presentation of the concept of ensemble inequivalence, as exemplified by the exact solution, in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles, of mean-field type models. Remarkably, the entropy of all these models can be obtained using the method of large deviations. Long-range interacting systems display an extremely slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium and, what is more striking, the convergence towards quasi-stationary states. The understanding of such unusual relaxation process is obtained by the introduction of an appropriate kinetic theory based on the Vlasov equation. A statistical approach, founded on a variational principle introduced by Lynden-Bell, is shown to explain qualitatively and quantitatively some features of quasi-stationary states. Generalizations to models with both short and long-range interactions, and to models with weakly decaying interactions, show the robustness of the effects obtained for mean-field models.},

Some models for which {NMFE} are valid will briefly be reviewed. It is found that, for certain choices of the interaction architecture, ferromagnetic systems (Jij ⩾ 0) exhibit weak spin-glass-like behaviour in the sense that they have many stable states and not just those associated with ferromagnetism. These extra stable states appear discontinuously. The application of these techniques to structured models of spin glasses and neural networks will also be briefly reviewed.},

Here, in the contrary, we see surprising nonmonotonic freezing behavior of the response with ω, showing curious peak-valley structure. Quite interestingly, the entire system tends to freeze almost absolutely (the freezing peaks) when driven with a certain combination of driving parameters values (amplitude and ω) due to coherent suppression of dynamics of the quantum many-body modes, which has no classical analog. We demonstrate this new freezing phenomenon analytically (supported by large-scale numerics) for a general class of integrable quantum spin systems.},

We show that for γ \&lt; (d − 1/2), the collision integral is dominated by the size of the system, while for γ \&gt; (d − 1/2), it is dominated by small impact parameters. In addition, the lifetime of {QSS} increases with the number of particles if γ \&lt; d − 1 (i.e. the force is not integrable) and decreases if γ \&gt; d − 1. Using numerical simulations we confirm our analytic results. A corollary of our work gives a ”dynamical” classification of interactions: the dynamical properties of the system depend on whether the pair force is integrable or not.},

Starting from the Jordan-Wigner transformation, which maps spin-1/2 systems into fermionic ones, we review some of the basic approaches to deal with the superconducting correlations that naturally emerge in this context. In particular, we analyse the form of the ground state and excitations of the model, relating them to the symmetry-breaking physics, and illustrate aspects connected to calculating dynamical quantities, thermal averages, correlation functions and entanglement entropy. A few problems provide simple applications of the techniques.},

When the dynamics is ergodic, the Floquet spectrum obeys a Wigner-Dyson statistics and the system satisfies the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ({ETH}): Independently of the initial state, local observables relax to the thermal value, and Floquet states are delocalized in the Hilbert space. On the contrary, if the classical dynamics is regular no thermalization occurs. We further discuss the relationship between ergodicity and dynamical phase transitions, and the relevance of our results to other fully connected periodically driven models (like the Bose-Hubbard one), and possibilities of experimental realization in the case of two coupled {BEC}.},

It turns out that long-range interactions give rise to a big timescale separation, which causes prethermalization for all . This conclusion is deduced by comparing two important timescales relevant for relaxation dynamics; one is the relaxation time of local permutation operators, which are quasi-conserved quantities in this system, and the other is the timescale of the initial relaxation of local quantities due to the growth of quantum fluctuations. We also explore the entire nonequilibrium dynamics by using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is consistent with the result mentioned above.},

	abstract = {Quantum interference lies at the heart of several surprising equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena in many-body Physics. Here we discuss two recently explored non-equilibrium scenarios where external periodic drive applied to closed (i.e., not attached to any external bath) quantum many-body systems have apparently opposite effects in respective cases. In one case it freezes/localizes a disorder free system dynamically, while in the other it delocalizes a disordered many-body localized system, and quantum interference is responsible for both the effects. We review these in the perspective of more general questions of ergodicity, energy absorption, asymptotic behavior, and finally the essential role of quantum mechanics in understanding these issues in periodically driven closed many-body systems. In this article we intend to deliver a non-technical account of some recent developments in this field in a manner accessible to a broad readership.},

	abstract = {Many-body-localized ({MBL}) systems do not thermalize under their intrinsic dynamics. The athermality of {MBL}, we propose, can be harnessed for thermodynamic tasks. We illustrate this ability by formulating an Otto engine cycle for a quantum many-body system. The system is ramped between a strongly localized {MBL} regime and a thermal (or weakly localized) regime. The difference between the energy-level correlations of {MBL} systems and of thermal systems enables mesoscale engines to run in parallel in the thermodynamic limit, enhances the engine's reliability, and suppresses worst-case trials. We estimate analytically and calculate numerically the engine's efficiency and per-cycle power. The efficiency mirrors the efficiency of the conventional thermodynamic Otto engine. The per-cycle power scales linearly with the system size and inverse-exponentially with a localization length. This work introduces a thermodynamic lens onto {MBL}, which, having been studied much recently, can now be considered for use in thermodynamic tasks.},
